# Text.py
- Creates a textbox with both dialouge to be displayed and name to indicate who is speaking (No images, only solid colors)
- Creates a general button (No images, only solid colors. To assign a function to the object, one should use "if {objectname}.draw():")
- Creates options button (No images, only solid colors. Relies on the button modules, so same method to assign a function to the object but with "if {objectname}.option_button.draw()".)
